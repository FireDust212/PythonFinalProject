This is our project for ECE 198. It is intended to be fun and get us a good grade.

## Motivation: What problem are you solving? 
We will be making a Vampire Survivors/Reverse bullet hell style game. 

## Method: What Python packages, APIs, and other tools do you plan on using?
We will use Pygame-ce and time for the main engine of the game, as well as random for elements of the game that will need to be randomized. 
Tutorials we followed:

## Intended experiments and evaluations (Metrics): How will you test whether your project code works as expected?
If a complete game can be played through, and a user (other than us) can figure out how to play. The game should be fun to play.

## Milestones: What major tasks are planned to accomplish this project?
* Getting Pygame working and making sure we understand it.
* Getting a gameplay loop working
* Adding graphics
* Improving the gameplay
* Adding a main menu and ending screen
* General improvements as time permits
